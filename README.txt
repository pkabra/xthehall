INTRODUCTION
------------
In the three weeks that an average patient spends in the ICU,
s/he generally suffers from physical and cognitive limitations.
These ailments limit patients’ ability to interact with the world
around them. While normally these people may be able to freely meet
with other individuals through person-to-person contact or social
networking, such modes of communication are more difficult for ICU
patients. A usable tool which allows patients to connect and communicate
with each other can make their stay in the ICU a bit more pleasant.

Our application, XtheHall (pronounced as “Cross the Hall”), serves this
purpose;  XtheHall is a mobile-friendly web application designed to help
patients interact with each other.  While the patient may be physically
bedridden, our application facilitates remote patient-to-patient
interactions. Though this application is built specifically for ICU
patients, XtheHall can also be generalized to be usable by those with
general physical and cognitive limitations. Ultimately, it is the goal
of the XtheHall team to create a social application that helps patients
successfully complete a stay in the ICU with more intellectual
stimulation and more great relationships.

DEPLOYMENT
----------
Once the source code has been downloaded, the application can be started
in one's terminal by entering the folder and running server.sh. The
application can then be reached in any internet browser on the user's

FEATURES
--------
Ease of Use and Accessibility: Our application was designed with the
    potential ailments of the end user under focus. As such, there are
    many different features in place to make the product easy to use.
    The most prominent of these is the voice control which can be
    enabled in the settings. A detailed list of the voice commands can be
    found bellow. Be sure to try all of them out! Also, remember to try
    the magnifying feature for the visually impaired by hitting the
    eye icon in the navigation bar.

Chat Infrastructure: Of course, the primary purpose of the XtheHall
    platform is to start conversations between patients in the same
    hospital. Our robust find-friends page allows users to find potential
    conversation partners who share common interests with them. At the
    same time, it is incredibly easy to simply click or tap on a few
    friends' profile pictures to initialize a chat. Automatically, those
    who share the most interests are higher up on the list of users. Our
    chatting system is designed to be very simple and clean to allow
    users to focus on the content of the conversations.

User Management: Our application is customizable to allow users to
    experience a very personal experience. Our customizability features
    can be managed in our settings, where users may modify their personal
    information, like their interest lists, and augment their feature
    sets, like by enabling voice control. At the same time, privacy of
    our users was a top priority, which is why a nickname instead of a
    user's name is stored in XtheHall's database.

Outside Resources: XtheHall leverages multiple other systems to the
    benefit of our user base. The team is very proud of these, like the
    incorporation of Facebook login, as they greatly improve the general
    experience of using the XtheHall platform.

VOICE COMMANDS
--------------
Remember that voice commands need to be enabled in the application's
settings. Then, once on a page of XtheHall, one can initiate a voice
command by saying the word "orange."
